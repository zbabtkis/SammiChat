Ionic is changing quickly as we work towards the beta.\n\n# What is Ionic?\n\nIonic is the open source HTML5 Mobile Framework for building amazing, cross-platform hybrid native apps with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Just like this one:\n\n![Weather Demo](http://ionicframework.com/img/weather1x.png)\n\nWe built Ionic because we wanted a framework that focused on building hybrid native apps, rather than mobile websites. We wanted this framework to be obsessive about great design and performance. A framework that left the past behind and focused on the future where mobile devices could make HTML5 feel native.\n\nIt's important to realize that Ionic is not a replacement for frameworks used for building mobile web apps. There are a lot\nof great solutions that work well for websites, like [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/).\n\nIonic is also not a good solution if you need to support older generation devices. Our [compatibility](http://ionicframework.com/docs/#browser-support) *starts* at iOS 6 and Android 4.1. We will never support versions earlier than those. This is a framework for the future.

This is bundled in `js/angular/` and `js/angular-ui-router/`.\n\n\n## Demos\n\n - [Ionic Codepen.io Demos](http://codepen.io/ionic/public-list)\n\n\n## Community\n\n* Follow [@ionicframework on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ionicframework).\n* Subscribe to the [Ionic Newsletter](http://ionicframework.com/subscribe/).\n* Have a question that's not a feature request or bug report?

Read about it [here](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md).\n\n### Commit Conventions\n\n* Uses http://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog conventions\n\n### Pushing Releases\n\n(uses AngularJS's bash utils - when you run any script, run it with `--git-push-dryrun=true` to do 'mock' git pushes)\n\n* Run `./scripts/release/finalize-version.sh --action=prepare` to:\n  - Remove version suffix\n  - Write new version to package/bower/component.json\n  - Move build files to `release/`\n  - Commit & tag the release\n* Run `./scripts/release/finalize-version.sh --action=publish` to:\n  - Push out new version\n* Once new version is pushed out, run `./scripts/release/initialize-new-version.sh` (usage is shown in file), to bump to next version with bump type / version suffix / version name specified.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nIonic is licensed under the MIT Open Source license.
